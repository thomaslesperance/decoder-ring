# decoder-ring

## Context
This project was completed to exercise skill in the fundamentals of JavaScript programming. It tackles the challenging task of creating a code mechanism for encryption and decryption of input strings using 3 different encryption ciphers.

## How to Use
The code can be demonstrated using a local test web server (e.g., with the Live Server extension for VSCode) which will render the simple HTML file and corresponding JavaScript. The UI will look similar to this:

For each of the three ciphers you wish to use, select if you want to encrpt or decrypt you input, type your message, select other options depending on cipher selection, and click submit. You will be given an output demonstrating the encyption/decryption selected.

## Features
The application offers encryption/decryption for ceasar shift, polybius square, and substitution ciphers.

## Technologies and Tools
This project uses vanilla JavaScript. The DOM is manipulated directly with JavaScript via event listeners. The application has a simple module/export structure and an accompanying package.json file with specifics on scripts to be used in your local test server.

## Conclusion
Future goals include extracting the cipher code and incorporating into other projects if desired.
